I have been focusing seriously on my health for the past year and especially for the past few months.
My main motivation is to do better in everything in life and the main driver is my kids.
I want to have the energy to play with them, enjoy their presence and be a good and fit role model.

The main things healh-wise I focus on are
- Eating healthy. I did OMAD and IF earlier this year, but switched to macronutrient tracking a few months back.
- Resistance training 3 times a week. Stronglifts program.
- Walking at least 10k steps per day.
- Habit tracking, to make sure I stay on track and do something hard every day. Examples of things I do every single day: 50 pushups, meditate, take creatine.

Some tools and apps I use to track and monitor my progress:
- Apple Health. For weight tracking (I weigh myself every single morning), heart rate variability and resting heart rate, using data from my Apple Watch.
- Waking Up by Sam Harris. Meditation.
- Pedometer++. To track my steps using Apple Watch.
- Notion. I created a template for Habit tracking. Notion is so slow sometimes that I want to move this to another tool, possibly creating my own.
- Google Sheets. My Stronglifts program is in there, and also my weekly macros evaluation.
- Cronometer. Tracking macros. Their free version offers features that competitors like MyFitnessPal charge a premium for, like barcode scanning and macro targets.

So far these things are working extremely well for me. I've managed to burn off a lot of fat, still some to go before I start building up more muscle mass.
The main thing though is that I've established a rock-solid routine which I manage to stick with no matter what.
