Deadlifts and Enya.
Those are two words you won't typically see together in a sentence.

Lately, at the gym, I've been listening solely to fast Death Metal.
This helps me feel motivated and energized through my weightlifting sets.

But after some time the effects of it seem to fade away.
Jumping right in to the action with fast and brutal music isn't cutting it for me right now.

So, last night I tried a different approach. 
I listened to Enya while lifting weights.
It was very encouraging and motivating in it's own way.

Deadlifts and Enya.
